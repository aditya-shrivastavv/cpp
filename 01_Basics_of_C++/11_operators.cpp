10. Explicit Typecasting Opertors
    int i;
    float f = 3.14;
    i = (int) f;
11. sizeof Operator
    This operator accepts one parameter, which can be either a type or a variable, and returns the size in bytes of that type or object:
        x = sizeof (char);
    Here, x is assigned the value 1, because char is a type with a size of one byte.
    The value returned by sizeof is a compile-time constant, so it is always determined before program execution.
